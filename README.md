# Sudoku Game

This project was built as part of a challenge i creatd for myself to keep coding since the beginning of January, this is my second project of the month. The aim of this project is to create a game called Sudoku which is a very popular brain-teaser game, and since i love to play soduku i intend to create a user-friendly, competitive, and eye-catching website for the game, and this is the result.
